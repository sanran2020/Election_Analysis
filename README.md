# Election_Analysis


## Overview of Election Audit
#### The purpose of this project is to audit Colorado election results using Python. If the audit using Python is successful, this method will be used for other election audits too.

## Election audit results
#### There are 4 aspects of the election that needs to be summarized for this audit: a) Total votes b) County votes c) Candidate votes and d) Winning candidate. Below is the summary:


1. Total Votes =  369,711
2. County Votes
	1. Jefferson = 10.5% (38,855)
	2. Denver = 82.8% (306,055)
	3. Arapahoe = 6.4% (24,801)
3. Candidate Votes
	1. Charles Casper Stockham = 23.0% (85,213)
	2. Diana DeGette = 73.8% (272,892)
	3. Raymon Anthony Doane =  3.1% (11,606)
3. Winning Candidate = **Diana DeGette**

## Election audit Summary
#### The Python code for audit has been executed successfully and this case is generic to use for other states with similar csv format for data. Additional improvements of the script could include a) reading the headers to identify votes, county and candidate names such that any column format can be read and b) Breaking down the election votes by different vote casting types.
